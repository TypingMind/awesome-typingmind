## Plugins

List of cool [TypingMind plugins](https://docs.typingmind.com/plugins).

> [!TIP]
> You are encouraged to host your plugins using a GitHub repository. All TypingMind's built-in plugins are open-source and maintained in their own separate repos at https://github.com/orgs/TypingMind/repositories.
>
> Creating a repo for your plugin will make it easier to upgrade your plugin without creating a unique cloud share every time. Users can also import your plugins using the GitHub link directly.
