# :fire::fire: Revamped ChatGPT Style Theme :fire::fire:

### I completely revamped the TypingMind interface with an extension that introduces a suite of enhancements and features to make it resemble ChatGPT more closely.

## Key Highlights

### 1. **Updated Font Styling**

- Adjusted font colors, sizes, and line heights to improve readability and consistency.
- Ensured text elements are visually appealing and  aligned with the overall design theme.

### 2. **Improved Interface Colors and Theme**

- The overall color palette and theme have been revamped to mirror the clean and modern look of ChatGPT.
- Sidebar and other interface elements now feature a light, visually appealing design for a more cohesive experience.

### 3. **Right-Aligned Chat Conversations**

- Chat conversations are now displayed on the right side with clean, rounded message bubbles.
- Removed the default blue styling, creating a more refined and professional appearance.
- Removed the user profile icon that appeared on top of every message for a more clean polished look

### 4. **Enhanced Text Parsing**

- **Single Quotes:** Text enclosed in single quotes (`'example'`) now appears bold, consistent with ChatGPT's formatting.
- **Triple Backticks:** Text within triple backticks (` ``` `) is displayed as a clean, formatted code block.

### 5. **Cleaner Code Blocks**

- Assistant responses containing code are now styled with a lighter background and slim borders.
- Code blocks now feature an improved appearance, making them more readable and visually integrated with the interface.
